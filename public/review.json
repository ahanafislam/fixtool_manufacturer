It was packed away for 10 years and I've just got it out again and blow me, it works like a dream. The original batteries charged perfectly. What an amazing product!"

As i bought the tools I didnt register them for warranty as I didnt think i would ever need to as they were Dewalt. 30 months after buying the tools, one drill got jammed in hammer position. I called Dewalt and asked what they could do. I explained i only used the drill about 4 times."
